# Fix Issue #1

> **Stand:** 5.2.2026

# Stories support (fork)

This fork adds a minimal Stories experience:
- Story rooms are identified by display name prefix `story:`.
- Stories appear in a dedicated horizontal section in the chat list.
- A full-screen story viewer displays image events from the room timeline and marks the room read when opened.
