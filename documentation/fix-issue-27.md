# Issue #27: Visual Ring Indicator for Unseen Stories

This fix adds a visual distinction to the stories bar. The previous gradient-based ring was replaced with a solid color ring that changes based on whether the user has unread stories in a room. 

Unseen stories are also sorted to the front for better visibility.
